## Note

This is the Implementation belonging to my Thesis Thesis "Image Restoration von MRT-Bildern mit Convolutional Neural Networks"

The necessary data for running the project is in this public release not included. Its only meant to give a insight to the projects structure and code. The code is mostly commented. Open test.ipynb to see results but dont execute the cells. 

The implemented CNN-Models are based on the Papers https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04667.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08921.pdf
